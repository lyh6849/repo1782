,"Complex data review included: self-monitoring blood glucose logs, food diary and labs including A1c, lipid panel, creatinine and eGFR (for medication dose adjustment), and urine microalbumin to creatinine ratio Factors adding to complexity and affecting decision making regarding medication dosing and adjustment include variability of oral intake and poor control of diabetes based on hemoglobin A1c. Overall Confessor's glycemic control at this time is not optimal. His fasting sugars vary, with some in goals and some above but his blood sugars in the evening are persistently elevated. His diet is rather high in carbohydrates and we discussed reducing these and maximizing proteins and vegetables will help improve his control. He does have some overnight lows, which makes increasing basal insulin challenging. The safest approach would be to increase Trulicity for better prandial coverage and slightly increase basal insulin for fasting coverage as follows: Glimepiride 2mg daily and 4mg with dinner Lantus 22 units nightly",0,0,0

,"Factors adding to complexity and affecting decision making regarding medication dosing and adjustment include variability of oral intake and poor control of diabetes based on hemoglobin A1c. Overall Confessor's glycemic control at this time is not optimal. His fasting sugars vary, with some in goals and some above but his blood sugars in the evening are persistently elevated. His diet is rather high in carbohydrates and we discussed reducing these and maximizing proteins and vegetables will help improve his control. He does have some overnight lows, which makes increasing basal insulin challenging. The safest approach would be to increase Trulicity for better prandial coverage and slightly increase basal insulin for fasting coverage as follows: Glimepiride 2mg daily and 4mg with dinner Lantus 22 units nightly Trulicity 3mg/week",0,0,0

,"None Operative Details: The patient presented with a complaint of difficulty seeing to see birds due to decreased vision in the left eye. Examination revealed a left cataract consistent with the patient's symptoms. The findings and option for cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation were reviewed with the patient. The risks and potential benefits, as well as the elective nature of the procedure were explained. The patient was given the opportunity to ask questions, understood the information presented, and made a voluntary choice to proceed. The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the table in the supine position. The skin around the left eye was prepped with 5% Betadine, as were the conjunctival fornices. A sterile drape with an opening for the eye was placed over the patient's head and torso, and the lashes were covered with Tegaderm. A speculum was placed between the lids. Following a surgical time-out, a temporally-located, 2.4 mm-long, 350 micron deep, incision was created at the limbus. A tunnel extended 2.4 mm into cornea with a bevel-up spatula blade. An inferotemporal limbal paracentesis was created at the limbus with a 15 degree blade, and 1% preservative-free lidocaine, followed by Viscoat, was injected into the anterior chamber. A 2.4 mm-wide keratome blade was used to enter the anterior chamber through the temporal tunnel. A 5.0 mm diameter continuous, curvilinear capsulorhexis was started with a cystitome needle, and completed with Utrata forceps. Hydrodisection and hydrodelineation were performed with a Chang canula. The nucleus and epinucleus were removed by phacoemulsification, and the cortex aspirated with the I/A handpiece. The capsular bag was inflated with Provisc, and a 22.0 diopter Alcon Acrysof SN60WF intraocular lens with serial number 15157195003 was placed within the capsular bag. The residual Viscoat and Provisc were aspirated from within the capsular bag and anterior camber. The wounds were stromally-irrigated with BSS on a 30-gauge canula and were water-tight. The correct positioning of the lens implant was confirmed. The lid speculum was partially closed and elevated off of the eye, and then the intraocular pressure was estimated by palpation to be 18 mmHg. The speculum and drapes were removed, and a drop of Vigamox, ketorolac 0.5%, and prednisolone 1% placed on the eye. A shield was taped over the eye. The patient tolerated the procedure well, with no complications, and was transported to recovery in stable condition.",0,0,0

His diet is rather high in carbohydrates and we discussed reducing these and maximizing proteins and vegetables will help improve his control. He does have some overnight lows, which makes increasing basal insulin challenging. The safest approach would be to increase Trulicity for better prandial coverage and slightly increase basal insulin for fasting coverage as follows: Glimepiride 2mg daily and 4mg with dinner Lantus 22 units nightly Trulicity 3mg/week Check BG 2 times daily.",0,0,0

,"The attenuation correction CT demonstrates the following additional findings: Status post CABG with median sternotomy. Unchanged aneurysmal dilation of the right coronary artery. Severe coronary artery calcifications. There is a left-sided aortic arch with an aberrant origin of the right subclavian artery coursing posterior to the esophagus and retropharyngeal course of the bilateral carotid arteries. Unchanged dilation of the ascending aorta measuring up to 4.5 cm. The descending thoracic aorta is tortuous. The main pulmonary artery branches are mildly enlarged, could be seen in the setting of pulmonary hypertension. Moderate calcified atherosclerosis of the aorta with aortobiiliac stenting. Upper lobe predominant emphysematous changes and mild right apical pleural-parenchymal scarring. Small hiatal hernia. Cholelithiasis. Sigmoid diverticulosis. Large left-sided inguinal hernia containing unobstructed loops of distal descending/proximal sigmoid colon. Healed right lateral 8th rib fracture. A right hip arthroplasty is present. Mild multilevel degenerative changes throughout the spine with exaggerated thoracic kyphosis. Surgical clips are again seen in the subcutaneous tissues of the medial right thigh. IMPRESSION: Further decrease in the size of the right lung lesion which continues to demonstrate FDG uptake similar to liver. There is however a mildly FDG avid 1.4 cm focus within the region of the suprahilar lung lesion, more prominent compared to prior examination, unclear if it represents uptake within the lung lesion or a right hilar lymph node.

,"The patient presented with a complaint of difficulty seeing to see birds due to decreased vision in the left eye. Examination revealed a left cataract consistent with the patient's symptoms. The findings and option for cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation were reviewed with the patient. The risks and potential benefits, as well as the elective nature of the procedure were explained. The patient was given the opportunity to ask questions, understood the information presented, and made a voluntary choice to proceed. The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the table in the supine position. The skin around the left eye was prepped with 5% Betadine, as were the conjunctival fornices. A sterile drape with an opening for the eye was placed over the patient's head and torso, and the lashes were covered with Tegaderm. A speculum was placed between the lids. Following a surgical time-out, a temporally-located, 2.4 mm-long, 350 micron deep, incision was created at the limbus. A tunnel extended 2.4 mm into cornea with a bevel-up spatula blade. An inferotemporal limbal paracentesis was created at the limbus with a 15 degree blade, and 1% preservative-free lidocaine, followed by Viscoat, was injected into the anterior chamber. A 2.4 mm-wide keratome blade was used to enter the anterior chamber through the temporal tunnel. A 5.0 mm diameter continuous, curvilinear capsulorhexis was started with a cystitome needle, and completed with Utrata forceps. Hydrodisection and hydrodelineation were performed with a Chang canula. The nucleus and epinucleus were removed by phacoemulsification, and the cortex aspirated with the I/A handpiece. The capsular bag was inflated with Provisc, and a 22.0 diopter Alcon Acrysof SN60WF intraocular lens with serial number 15157195003 was placed within the capsular bag. The residual Viscoat and Provisc were aspirated from within the capsular bag and anterior camber. The wounds were stromally-irrigated with BSS on a 30-gauge canula and were water-tight. The correct positioning of the lens implant was confirmed. The lid speculum was partially closed and elevated off of the eye, and then the intraocular pressure was estimated by palpation to be 18 mmHg. The speculum and drapes were removed, and a drop of Vigamox, ketorolac 0.5%, and prednisolone 1% placed on the eye. A shield was taped over the eye. The patient tolerated the procedure well, with no complications, and was transported to recovery in stable condition. Tad D Baum, MD Phone Number: 978-534-2426",0,0,0
