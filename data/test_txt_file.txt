HISTORY: Shoulder replaced, rotator cuff tear suspected M25.512 - I10 - Pain in left shoulder - Non-Contrast Exam tttundefined
Charles S Sleeper is a 57 y.o. male sp left partial-thickness rotator cuff tear. We discussed the possibility of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair versus continued conservative management. He would like to attempt continued conservative management. We discussed the possibility of a intra-articular corticosteroid injection to see if this helps alleviate his pain as the tear is primarily articular sided in nature. I will see him back in 2 to 3 months for repeat evaluation. The intra-articular corticosteroid injection was ordered today. tttundefined

3. Symptoms are consistent with burning mouth syndrome, a craniofacial pain syndrome. No physical or anatomic abnormalities were found and physical exam was normal. We discussed the natural course of the disease, namely that about half of patients improve spontaneously. I have recommended a daily multivitamin. In addition, I offered a lidocaine mouthwash for sx management. Rx sent. If these measures are not effective, I have suggested f/u with pcp for poss neurology referral and consideration of systemic therapy including tricyclic antidepressants. 4. I counseled the patient to follow up as needed, if signs or symptoms worsen or progress, including dysphagia, worsening pain, new spots or ulcers in the mouth, new neck masses, bleeding, or shortness of breath.
